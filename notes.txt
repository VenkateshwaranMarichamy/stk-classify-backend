Request → main.py (FastAPI app)
            → routers/stocks.py (route + get_db_session from database.py)
                 → schemas (validate request, shape response)
                 → models (Stock) + AsyncSession (from database.py)
                 → database (actual queries)
            → Response (using schemas)


core = config + logger
models = DB tables
schemas = API in/out
routers = URL → logic
database.py = engine, session, init, get_db_session
main.py = create app, init DB, mount routers, health route


okay let get to our business.
I have 4 tables in schema classification 
macro_economic_sectors, sectors, industriesm, basoc industries.
I need to expose a API to retrieve and send these as response. can you show me a design and the sample request and response youare planning to do
